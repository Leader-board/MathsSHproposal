# The Maths S-H document

My aim is to provide a comprehensive framework for the potential improvement of the Mathematics curricumum of CBSE for Class 11 and 12. While I mostly focus on that, I also touch upon the overall examination pattern - as you'll see, some of the improvements are effective for all subjects.

This is only a (very) brief summary, plesae see the document for the full details.

# The proposed changes

- Subjects should be divided into two tiers - the Standard and Higher tiers, mimicking what the IB does on that regard. This enables students to pick the level they want for each subject, as some might want to study Physics but not to the level demanded by Physics-H, for instance. There is provision for switching tiers under some circumstances.
- The Class 12 exams for both Maths variants will contain questions across both Class 11 and 12. While students might complain that the workload is doubled, in reality that's not the case.
- The examination pattern should not be rigid and fixed; there should be flexibility to ask a wide variety of questions (this is shown in the sample papers). The maximum mark per question should be raised to 8.
- There are minor curriculum changes for both variants; in particular, the Maths-H portion has been increased. The curriculum cannot be reduced, and this is stressed in the full document.
- The average mark will reduce noticiably (with a corresponding decrease in grade cutoffs), and a provision for a "concordance table" is suggested to allevate this issue (no moderation/standardisation please)
- (under consideration) 25-mark questions with an in-depth focus on topics

In addition, a sample paper for each variant is included, with answers and difficulty thoughts. Furthermore, a 'pool' of extra questions have also been included (answers are unavailable for them)
